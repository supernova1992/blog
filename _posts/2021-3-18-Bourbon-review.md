## Whiskey background
blah blah blah blah

## Price
$38

## Nose
Vanilla, cinnamon, toffee, nutmeg, oak, some BBQ/Molasses notes.

## Taste
Again vanilla, leather, brief cherry, shortbread or buttery baked good, almonds/amaretto and clear earthy oak.

## Finish
hint of mint and the rest of the palate fades evenly.

## Overall
A classic, balanced bourbon. A bit heavy on the leather and wood, but this one really depends on the context, it shines best when I've had a pour of something else just before. I DO wish it was easier to find, it's a great bourbon - but honestly I would NOT want to spend more than $45 on a bottle.
