Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

```python
import bungus

with open('file.txt','w') as file:
  file.write(bungus(10000))


```

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
